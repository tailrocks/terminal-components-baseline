# Current state

This repository is the design reference implementation: a Cargo workspace
of two crates (edition 2024, Rust 1.99.1). `junie-tui` (v0.1.0) holds the
terminal component library and the showcase, tablepro and holla demo
applications. `jackin-console` (`apps/jackin`) holds the jackin demo: a
library of the jackin console screens plus the `jackin` binary. It is
the exact authority for product appearance and interaction (see
[product](product.md)). The modular multi-crate workspace described in
[architecture](architecture.md) is the future refactoring state; it
does not exist in this tree yet.

## Structure

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib.rs` | Library root (`junie_tui`); public module surface. |
| `src/core/` | Foundational types: IDs, events, intents, validation, diagnostics. |
| `src/shell/` | Application shell behaviour shared by every app: focus routing, hit testing, layers, modals, hints, help, quit guards. |
| `src/ui/` | Rendering context, overlay layer (`RenderCtx::overlay`, `flush_overlays`, `begin_modal`, `modal_backdrop`), paint primitives. |
| `src/widgets/` | The reusable component families (lists, trees, tables, fields, dialogs, menus, pickers, editors, scroll regions, splits). |
| `src/bin/showcase/` | Showcase: the executable component catalog (54 sidebar pages, plus the hidden pages `terminalpane` and `fixedcontrols`). Thin consumer: pages add wiring, demo data and option tables only. |
| `src/bin/tablepro/` | TablePro: simulated database workbench (connections, explorer, query tabs, results, history). |
| `src/bin/holla/` | Holla: simulated launcher/finder, files, disk cleanup, services. Backends are simulated; tests assert the next in-app consequence. |
| `src/terminal.rs` | Terminal pane block (feature `terminal`): `TerminalState`, `TermView`, `TermEvent`, `TerminalView`, `encode_key`. It renders a `termpane` grid fed from a byte stream, returns the events the stream raised (replies, title, clipboard, bell, notification, cwd, scrollback cleared) and does no I/O. |
| `apps/jackin/src/` | The `jackin-console` library (`jackin_console`): the jackin screens (manager, editor, accounts, usage, settings, cockpit, capsule, prelude, roles, doctor and the modals), the `domain` types, `rain` and the other jackin-only modules, over the plain-data `world::World` and the `backend::Backend` and `backend::OnePassword` interfaces. |
| `apps/jackin/src/fixtures/`, `apps/jackin/src/sim/` | The 14 fixture worlds (`fixtures::world_for`) and the simulated `Backend`, `OnePassword` and launch content, in the library behind the `fixtures` feature so the jackin repository can render the same worlds. |
| `apps/jackin/src/bin/jackin/` | The jackin demo binary: the command line over `fixtures` and `sim`. Binary name is `jackin` (`cargo run --bin jackin`). |
| `apps/jackin/tests/*.rs` | Library tests of the `jackin-console` data API (`World`, `Snapshot`, the time source, external messages), run by `cargo nextest run --all-targets`. They are not part of the CI `functional` suite. |
| `apps/jackin/tests/functional/` | The jackin journeys and their approved baselines (`baselines/functional/jackin_*.tui.json`), on the shared harness `tests/functional/support.rs`. |
| `tests/functional/` | The root crate's test estate: live PTY functional/integration tests plus the frozen visual gate. See [functional testing](functional-testing.md). |
| `.velnor/config.toml` | Source of truth for generated CI (`.github/` is generated, never hand-edited). See [CI](ci.md). |

## Cargo features

| Feature | Default | Adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cli` | yes | `clap`, the `cli` module and `Motion` as a `clap::ValueEnum`. The four binaries require it; `jackin-console` enables it on its `junie-tui` dependency. |
| `terminal` | yes | `termpane` and the `terminal` module. |

`jackin-console` has one feature, `fixtures` (default): the `fixtures`
and `sim` modules and the `jackin` binary. A consumer that supplies its
own `World` and `Backend` turns it off.

## jackin-console data hooks

A consumer changes content, never structure, through `World` fields and
`Surfaces` (`domain::surfaces`). Every default is the fixture behaviour,
so the approved baselines do not move.

| Hook | Default | What it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `World::new(WorldParts)` | | Builds a `World` without a struct literal; later fields get defaults. |
| `World.time` | `TimeSource::Sim` | `Wall(WallSource)` follows the host clock and UTC offset in `World::tick`. |
| `World::apply(Snapshot)` | | Replaces workspaces, roles, instances, global config, accounts, surfaces and GitHub repos; keeps panes, jobs, clock and filesystem. |
| `App::with_external`, `Remote` | no receiver | Lets another thread send `Remote::Msg` or `Remote::Reloaded` to the app. |
| `Surfaces.vocabulary` | demo words | Names the project, sandbox, terminal, gateway, GitHub, quit, stop and purge strings (`Vocabulary::openshell()` is the OpenShell set; `DaemonWords` and `LifecycleWords` group the gateway and the stop and purge texts). |
| `Surfaces.version`, `Surfaces.about` | `0.9.2`, `None` | The version shown in Debug info and the rows of the About dialog; `None` keeps the four demo rows (`World::about_props`). |
| `Surfaces.account_form` | four providers, three sources | Provider and source lists, labels, the preselected source and the 1Password note. |
| `Account.launch_blocked`, `Account.edit_blocked` | `None` | A usage-only account is not offered for launch; an account the form cannot represent keeps its other actions. `edit_blocked` is an `Option<EditBlocked>` (`text` and a required `short`): the status shows `text`, the menu border shows `short`. |
| `Surfaces.agent_blocked` | `None` | Every agent except one is a disabled launch row with a reason. |
| `Surfaces.launch_role` | `Demo` | `Configured` resolves the launch role from the default or the only allowed role, else the picker rows are disabled with a reason. |
| `Surfaces.wizard` | `None` | One fixed destination, no edit step, no subfolders, and the name from the source folder. The P9.3 design calls this `Fixed.wizard`; the code keeps `Surfaces.wizard`, and B4 does not move it. |

## Rules that hold today

- Behaviour lives in the shared library (`src/core`, `src/shell`,
  `src/ui`, `src/widgets`), never duplicated per screen or per app.
  Apps provide routes, pages and configuration only.
- Every widget follows the same conventions: builders, events,
  outcomes, one keyboard-focus gutter (`Theme::gutter_symbol`),
  selection distinct from focus, light-dismiss owned by the popup.
- Behaviour is overridable in layers: app/profile policy, then
  per-widget setting, then user key remapping.
- A control with one true value is `Control::Fixed(Reason)` (`core::refusal`): `Checkbox`, `Select`, `Button`, one `RadioGroup` option and one `ListItem` take `.fixed(reason)` or `.control(..)`. It stays in the focus ring, draws the disabled look with the `▎` gutter when focused, and refuses an edit: the value is untouched, the widget returns `Consumed` (`Select`, `Button`: `(Consumed, ..)`) and raises the reason into a thread-local slot (`RefCell<Option<Reason>>`). The call site reads the slot with `take_refusal()` (which clears it) and posts it with `Cx::refused(Reason)`, a neutral status of the reason text alone that lasts 5 s. `shell::handle` clears the slot at the start and at the end of each input, and redraws whenever an input changed the status line (text or tone), so a refusal by key paints at once. `Cx::sticky` posts a neutral status that does not expire and clears on the next key, paste or mouse press (`StatusLine::set_sticky_with`); it is for text a user must read or copy. A `Dialog` routes its mnemonics and its confirm key through `Button::activate`, and every finish (Enter in a prompt field, the typed acknowledgement) through `Button::refuse`, so a fixed action refuses on every route and `Dialog::hints` does not offer it. A fixed `ListItem` keeps its checked state through every selection path. `Reason` limits: text 60 columns, `short` 20 (`Reason::within_limits`); `ContextMenu::reason_room` is the room of the menu border. The showcase page `fixedcontrols` shows it. `Table` rows have no fixed state yet.
- The showcase demonstrates every library capability; the coverage
  gate is described in
  [shared components plan](architecture/shared-components-plan.md).

## Testing today

- `cargo nextest run --locked --test functional --profile functional`
  — 93 tests, 0 skipped: every app end-to-end (launch → operate →
  verify consequence → reopen → clean exit), component families in
  Showcase and in a real consumer, colour matrix
  (truecolor/256/16/mono/`NO_COLOR`), normal and small sizes.
- Every test but the key tests of a refusal page ends in
  `App::visual("<id>")` (see [functional testing](functional-testing.md)), a `FrozenStore` check
  against a committed baseline in `tests/functional/baselines/`.
  Baselines are approved only via the Tuiscotti CLI `accept` command.
- Full account of the deleted legacy estate and its replacement
  mapping: [functional testing](functional-testing.md).

## Known limits

- `TerminalState::scrolled_off` is exact while the history is below its
  limit (it follows the growth of `scrollback_len`). At the limit it sums
  the primary-screen scroll operations that start at row 0, so a delete-line
  at row 0 over-counts and the rows that `ESC[2J` keeps (termpane's
  preserve-on-clear) are not counted.
- The crate is a monolith: library and four binaries in one package.
  Splitting it is the refactoring programme in
  [architecture](architecture.md); no part of that split has landed.
- Applications simulate their backends (PostgreSQL, Docker,
  filesystem). No real external effect is claimed or tested.
- The `visual-baseline` git tag is frozen historical evidence. It is
  never moved, and it is not a substitute for the current design.
