    gaps = """# Known gaps

These are current-source observations. They are not permission to change product behaviour.

## Catalog and specimen

`SpecimenState` has 14 states, including `editing`.
`src/catalog.rs` lists 13 `state::` ids and omits `editing`.
Pages that draw `editing` still owe a specimen checkpoint.
The catalog entry is not added in this test programme because that is a production change.
The omission stays a characterized inventory gap.

## Clock paste

The shared harness sets `JUNIE_TUI_TEST_CLOCK=1` and Showcase page visits paste `junie-tui:advance-clock:`.
Only Jackin overrides `advance_clock` to consume that paste.
`shell::handle` still delivers the paste as ordinary input when `advance_clock` returns `None`.
The harness must stop sending the paste to applications that do not implement it.
No production clock hook is added to Showcase.

## Existing claims

The keyboard-activation test can accept a result from an earlier click.
The table-sort test discards the row-order value it captured.
The form test does not reset or submit a valid form.
The dialog test does not cycle the modal focus ring.
The Jackin stop, settings, launch-failure, and reconnect baselines do not show the state their names claim.
TablePro `resize_60x20` and Holla `resize_narrow` are 120 by 40 because they were captured after the terminal grew.
Those captures are retired only when a reference binary produces a replacement with a new baseline id.

## Historical visual-baseline

The local repository has no `visual-baseline` tag.
`git ls-remote --tags origin` returned no tags.
The GitHub release `visual-baseline` was not found.
Historical parity is not claimed. The tag is not created.

## Simulated backends

TablePro, Holla, and Jackin simulate their services.
A passing journey does not prove PostgreSQL, Docker, a credential provider, a daemon, or a host export.
